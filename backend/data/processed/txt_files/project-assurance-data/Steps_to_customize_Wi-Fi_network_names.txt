Step
Details


1

Open a web browser.
                Use any web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
            


2

Enter the router's IP address.
                Type 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1 into the address bar and press Enter.
                Note: If neither IP address works, check the router's manual or the label on the router.



3

Log in to the router's admin panel.
                Enter the username and password. The default is often admin/admin or admin/password.
                Note: If you've changed the credentials and can't remember them, you might need to reset your router.



4

Navigate to the Wireless Settings.
                Look for a section named "Wireless," "Wi-Fi," or something similar.
            


5

Locate the SSID field.
                Find the field labeled "SSID" (this is your network name).
            


6

Enter your desired network name.
                Type in your preferred Wi-Fi network name.
            


7

Save the changes.
                Click on the "Save" or "Apply" button to save your new settings.
            


8

Restart your router (if necessary).
                Some routers may require a reboot for the changes to take effect.
            


Additional Tips

Use a unique, easy-to-remember name for your Wi-Fi network to avoid confusion with nearby networks.
Avoid including sensitive information in your network name (e.g., your address or full name).
If using a dual-band router, consider setting different names for the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz networks for easier identification.
