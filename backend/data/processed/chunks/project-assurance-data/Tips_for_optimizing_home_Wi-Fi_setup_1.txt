Optimizing Router Settings

Update Firmware: Ensure the router's firmware is up-to-date to benefit from the latest performance improvements and security patches.
Select Best Channel: Use the router’s interface or apps like Wi-Fi Analyzer to find and set the least congested Wi-Fi channel.
Use Dual-Band Routers: If available, utilize both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands to balance the load and avoid congestion.

Security Measures

Strong Password: Use a strong and unique password for both your Wi-Fi network and the router interface to prevent unauthorized access.
Enable Encryption: Turn on WPA3 (if supported) or WPA2 encryption to secure the network communications.
Disable WPS: Turn off Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) to avoid security vulnerabilities.

Additional Equipment

Wi-Fi Extenders: Install Wi-Fi extenders or mesh systems to boost coverage in larger homes or areas with weak signals.
Powerline Adapters: Use powerline adapters to extend your network using existing electrical wiring.
