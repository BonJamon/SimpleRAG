Network Extenders: For larger homes, suggest Wi-Fi extenders or mesh networks to improve coverage.
Device Management: Advise customers to limit the number of connected devices or allocate bandwidth to critical devices.
Regular Updates: Ensure firmware for all devices is up to date to benefit from the latest security patches and performance improvements.
