Suggested Response


Why is my signal weak?
Signal strength can vary due to factors such as distance from network towers, physical obstructions like buildings, and weather conditions. Checking our coverage map can help locate the nearest tower.


Can I get 5G in my area?
Please provide your location or use our online coverage map to check if 5G services are available in your area. We are continuously working to expand our 5G network.


What do I do if I have no coverage?
First, ensure your device is set to the correct network mode. If the issue persists, consider restarting your device or contacting us for further support. In some cases, a signal booster may be beneficial.


How does roaming work?
When you travel outside our primary coverage area, your phone may connect to partnering networks. Note that additional charges may apply, and it's best to check our roaming plans for detailed information.
