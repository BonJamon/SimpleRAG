Connection Verification: Make sure all cables are connected securely and correctly.
Device Interference: Identify and remove any devices that could be causing signal interference.
Check for Updates: Verify if the router/modem firmware and customer’s devices have the latest updates. Guide the customer in performing updates if needed.
