Will there be any interruption to my service?
There may be a brief interruption during the transfer, but we strive to minimize downtime. Your service at the old address will be active until the day of the transfer.


Can I keep my current phone number?
If you are transferring within the same area code, it is generally possible to keep your current phone number. Please confirm with our customer service team.
