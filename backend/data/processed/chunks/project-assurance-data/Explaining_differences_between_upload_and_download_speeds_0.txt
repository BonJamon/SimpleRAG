Download Speed
The rate at which data is transferred from the Internet to the user's device. Measured in megabits per second (Mbps).


Upload Speed
The rate at which data is transferred from the user's device to the Internet. Measured in megabits per second (Mbps).


Key Differences

Primary Use: Download speeds are typically used for activities like streaming videos, downloading files, and browsing websites, whereas upload speeds are important for sending emails, video calls, and uploading content to the cloud.
Common Ratios: Download speeds are usually higher than upload speeds because most consumer Internet usage relies on downloading data. Typical consumer plans might have download speeds that are significantly higher than upload speeds. For example, a plan might offer 100Mbps download and 10Mbps upload.
Customer Impact: Customers may notice slower upload speeds when trying to share large files, participate in HD video calls, or live stream. It’s important to set correct expectations and suggest plans suited for their needs.
