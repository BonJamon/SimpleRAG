                Find the field labeled "SSID" (this is your network name).

Enter your desired network name.

                Type in your preferred Wi-Fi network name.

                Click on the "Save" or "Apply" button to save your new settings.

Restart your router (if necessary).

                Some routers may require a reboot for the changes to take effect.

            


Additional Tips

Use a unique, easy-to-remember name for your Wi-Fi network to avoid confusion with nearby networks.
Avoid including sensitive information in your network name (e.g., your address or full name).
If using a dual-band router, consider setting different names for the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz networks for easier identification.
