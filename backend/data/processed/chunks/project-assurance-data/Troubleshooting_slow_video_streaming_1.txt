Reduce Network Congestion
Identify and minimize other devices or applications that may be consuming significant bandwidth on the network.

Ask the customer if other devices are streaming or downloading large files. If so, try pausing these activities.
Recommend switching to a wired Ethernet connection if the customer is using Wi-Fi, as this can provide a more stable connection.



Device Performance
Ensure the customer's device is capable of streaming video efficiently.

Verify that the customer's device and streaming app are both updated to the latest versions.
Suggest closing other applications running in the background that may affect performance.



Streaming Service Issues
Determine if the issue is related to the streaming service itself.

Check if the streaming service is experiencing widespread issues. This can be done by visiting websites such as DownDetector.
Ask if the customer experiences slow streaming on multiple streaming platforms, which may indicate a broader issue.
