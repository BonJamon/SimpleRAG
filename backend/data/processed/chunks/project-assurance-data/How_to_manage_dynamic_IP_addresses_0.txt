How to Manage Dynamic IP Addresses




Managing Dynamic IP Addresses


Introduction
Dynamic IP addresses are IP addresses that are assigned to devices on a network but change periodically. These IP addresses are managed by a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server which automatically assigns a temporary IP address to a device from a predefined range. This guide will help QuickConnect customer service agents in supporting customers who have inquiries related to dynamic IP addresses.


Steps to Manage Dynamic IP Addresses

Identify the Device: Determine the device for which the IP address needs to be managed. This can be any networking device like a computer, phone, or router.
Access DHCP Settings: Many modern routers allow users to access DHCP settings through their web interface. Instruct the customer to:

                
Open a web browser.
Enter the router's IP address (usually 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1).
Login to the router's admin interface using the provided credentials.


Locate the DHCP Settings: Navigate to the appropriate section often labeled as "Network Settings," "LAN Setup," or "DHCP Settings." The terminology may vary depending on the router.
Adjust the IP Address Range: Here, users can often specify the range of IP addresses that the DHCP server can assign. Ensure they know to:

                
Set an appropriate range to include enough IP addresses for their network.
Avoid overlapping with static IP addresses to prevent conflicts.
