Can PPV charges be refunded?
Refunds for PPV charges are typically not provided unless there was a service error, such as the content not being available or unwatchable due to technical issues. Review the specifics of each request to determine eligibility.


How can I prevent accidental PPV purchases?
Customers can set parental controls or pin codes on their account to restrict unauthorized PPV orders. Guide them through the process if they are interested.


Step-by-Step Guidance
Checking Pay-Per-View Orders

Access the customer’s account via the customer service portal.
Navigate to the "Billing" section and locate the most recent statement.
Identify any PPV charges listed in the breakdown of charges.
Review the order history in the "PPV Purchases" section to verify the details of each charge.

Assisting with Parental Controls

Guide the customer to the "Settings" section of their QuickConnect account.
