Components of a Network Health Report
A Network Health Report typically includes the following components:

Uptime Statistics: A summary of the network’s uptime and any periods of downtime.
Latency Metrics: Details on network latency, including average, maximum, and minimum values over the selected period.
Packet Loss Data: Information on any packet loss encountered during the report timeframe.
Error Rates: Data regarding any errors or faults within the network.
Traffic Analysis: Insights into network traffic patterns, including data usage trends.

Considerations for Interpretations
When reviewing and discussing Network Health Reports with customers, keep the following considerations in mind:

Consistency: Point out trends and consistent performance issues that may require a long-term solution.
Severity: Highlight any critical issues or anomalies that might indicate immediate attention.
Impacts: Explain how particular metrics (like high latency or packet loss) may impact the customer’s network performance.
