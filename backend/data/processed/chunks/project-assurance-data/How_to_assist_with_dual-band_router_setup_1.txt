Step-by-Step Setup Guide

Step 1: Physical Connection

Unbox the router and plug it into a power outlet.
Connect the router to the modem using the Ethernet cable (connect the modem's LAN port to the router's WAN port).
Wait for the router to power on completely (typically indicated by status LEDs).



Step 2: Access Router's Web Interface

Open a web browser on a device connected to the router (either via Wi-Fi or Ethernet).
Enter the router's IP address (commonly 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1) in the browser's address bar.
Log in using the default username and password (often found on a sticker on the router).



Step 3: Initial Setup Wizard

Follow the Initial Setup Wizard if prompted. Otherwise, go to "Wireless Settings".
Choose to set up both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands.



Step 4: Configure Wireless Settings

For the 2.4 GHz band: 

                
Set the SSID (network name).
Select a channel (auto or a less crowded one).
Set the encryption method (WPA2-PSK is recommended).


For the 5 GHz band: 

                
Set the SSID (network name) as well, preferably different from 2.4 GHz SSID.
Select a channel.
Set the same encryption method as the 2.4 GHz band.
