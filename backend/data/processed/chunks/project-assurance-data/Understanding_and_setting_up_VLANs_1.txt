What devices or departments need to be on separate VLANs?
Are there specific security or performance requirements?
Do they have existing network hardware that supports VLANs?

2. Configure VLANs on Network Devices
Guide the customer on how to configure VLANs on their network devices:

Access the Network Switch: Log in to the management interface of the network switch.
Create VLANs: Navigate to the VLAN configuration section and create new VLANs with specific IDs.
Assign Ports to VLANs: Assign the necessary ports to each VLAN based on the customer’s requirements.

3. Configure VLANs on Devices
Ensure that the end-devices (computers, printers, etc.) are configured to use the correct VLANs:

Static Configuration: Manually set the VLAN ID on the device's network interface.
Dynamic Configuration: Use Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) options to assign VLAN settings.

4. Test the VLAN Setup
Verify that the VLANs are working as expected by performing the following tests:

Ping devices within the same VLAN to check connectivity.
Attempt to access resources restricted to particular VLANs to test security settings.
Ensure that devices on different VLANs cannot communicate unless explicitly allowed.
