Guidelines for Installing Network Extenders
Overview
Network extenders, also known as Wi-Fi boosters or repeaters, are devices designed to extend the coverage area of your wireless network. They function by receiving the existing Wi-Fi signal, amplifying it, and then transmitting the boosted signal. This document provides step-by-step guidelines to assist customers in installing network extenders effectively.
Preparation

Ensure you have your network extender device and its power adapter.
Have your Wi-Fi network name (SSID) and password handy.
Download the manufacturer's installation app if available (e.g., TP-Link Tether, Netgear Nighthawk).
Identify a location approximately midway between your router and the area with weak signal coverage.
