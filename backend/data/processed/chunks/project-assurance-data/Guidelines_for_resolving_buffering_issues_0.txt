Guidelines for Resolving Buffering Issues
Buffering issues can be frustrating for customers, especially when they are trying to stream videos or conduct important online activities. This guide provides step-by-step instructions to help customer service agents troubleshoot and resolve buffering issues effectively.
Common Causes of Buffering

Poor internet connection
High network traffic
Outdated software or hardware
Network interference
ISP throttling

Troubleshooting Steps

Check Internet Speed
Ensure that the customer's internet speed meets the required threshold for their activities.

Use online speed test tools (e.g., Speedtest by Ookla).
Recommend higher-speed plans if speeds are insufficient.


Reduce Network Traffic
Minimize the number of devices and applications using the network.

Suggest disconnecting unused devices.
Close bandwidth-heavy applications such as file downloads, online backups, etc.


Restart Devices
Restart the modem, router, and the device experiencing buffering.

Unplug each device, wait 30 seconds, then plug them back in.


Update Software and Hardware
Ensure that the customer's device and all relevant software are up to date.

Check for firmware updates for the router.
Update the streaming app or browser.


Relocate Equipment
Move the router to a central location or closer to the device experiencing issues.

Avoid placing the router near thick walls or electronic devices that might cause interference.


Check for Throttling
Confirm if the customer's ISP is throttling the connection.
