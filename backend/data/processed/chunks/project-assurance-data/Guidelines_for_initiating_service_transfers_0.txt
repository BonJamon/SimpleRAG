Note: Service transfers are the process by which a current QuickConnect service plan is moved from one location to another or from one customer to another. These should be handled with care to ensure seamless continuity of service.

        
Types of Service Transfers

Residential Transfer: Moving services from one residential address to another.
Business Transfer: Transferring services from one business address to another.
Customer Transfer: Changing ownership of the service from one customer to another.

Steps for Initiating a Service Transfer

Customer Verification: Verify the identity of the customer requesting the transfer. Ensure they have the necessary permissions and that their account is in good standing.
Collect Transfer Details: Gather all relevant information including:

                
Current and new service addresses
Preferred transfer date
Contact information of new customers (if applicable)


Check for Service Availability: Confirm that QuickConnect services are available at the new location.
Schedule the Transfer: Coordinate a date and time for the service transfer, keeping in mind the customer’s preferred date.
Service Confirmation: Inform the customer about the transfer details and confirm the service transfer appointment.
Installation and Setup: Ensure that all technical setups and installations are completed on the scheduled date.
Follow-Up: Contact the customer post-transfer to ensure everything is working as expected and address any issues promptly.
