Guidelines for Optimizing Gaming Performance



Introduction
Gaming performance is critical for a seamless and enjoyable gaming experience. Below are guidelines that can help optimize gaming performance for our customers.


Hardware Optimization

Upgrade GPU: Ensure the graphics processing unit (GPU) is powerful enough to handle modern games.
Increase RAM: At least 16GB of RAM is recommended for optimal gaming performance.
Solid State Drive (SSD): Use an SSD instead of a hard drive to decrease load times and improve overall system responsiveness.



Software Optimization

Update Drivers: Regularly update GPU, audio, and chipset drivers.
Operating System Updates: Keep the operating system up-to-date to ensure compatibility with new game releases and hardware.
Game Settings: Adjust in-game settings for a balance between performance and visual quality. Lowering resolution and turning off unnecessary visual effects can significantly improve performance.



Network Optimization

Wired Connection: Use a wired Ethernet connection instead of Wi-Fi for a more stable and faster connection.
Router Placement: Place the router in an open space and as close to the gaming device as possible.
Quality of Service (QoS): Enable QoS on the router to prioritize gaming traffic over other types of internet traffic.
