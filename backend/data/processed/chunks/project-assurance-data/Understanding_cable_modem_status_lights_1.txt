Troubleshooting Common Issues
If a customer reports issues with their internet connection, the status lights on the modem can provide vital clues. Here are some common scenarios and troubleshooting steps:

No Power Light: Verify that the power cord is securely plugged into both the modem and the electrical outlet. Try a different outlet if necessary.
Downstream/Upstream Light Amber: Check the coaxial cable connection and ensure it’s tightly secured. Restart the modem. If the problem persists, it might be an issue with the service provider.
No Online Light: Restart the modem. Check if there’s a known outage in the area. If the online light remains off, try resetting the modem to factory settings (refer to the modem’s manual for instructions).
No LAN/WAN Light: Ensure the Ethernet cable is correctly plugged in at both ends. Confirm that the connected device (e.g., a PC or router) is turned on and functioning properly.
