Impact of Latency



Latency Range
Perceived Impact




0 - 150 milliseconds
Low latency; generally not noticeable and does not affect communication.


150 - 300 milliseconds
Moderate latency; slight delay may be noticed but doesn't significantly affect conversation flow.


300 - 600 milliseconds
High latency; noticeable delay, which can impact the fluidity of conversation.


> 600 milliseconds
Very high latency; significant delay causing interruptions in communication, making it challenging to engage in effective conversation.



Tips to Minimize Latency

Use a Wired Connection: Whenever possible, use a wired connection instead of Wi-Fi to reduce network congestion.
Upgrade Internet Plan: Ensure the customer has a high-speed internet plan suitable for video conferencing.
Close Unnecessary Applications: Closing other applications that use bandwidth can help reduce latency.
Update Software and Hardware: Keeping video conferencing software and hardware up-to-date ensures optimal performance.
Position Near Router: If using Wi-Fi, advise the customer to be as close to the router as possible to minimize interference.
