Data Cap
Each mobile plan has a data cap after which data speed may be reduced.


Speed Reduction
Once the data cap is reached, customers will experience reduced internet speed.


Extra Charges
No extra charges for exceeding usage limits, but speed will be throttled.


Monitoring
Data usage is monitored and customers are notified when they approach or exceed their limits.

Provide Examples: Use examples to illustrate what exceeding the data cap means for the customer's service.
Offer Solutions: Suggest plans with higher data limits if customers frequently exceed their current plan's cap.
Be Empathetic: Understand that customers may feel frustrated by speed reductions, and show empathy in your responses.
