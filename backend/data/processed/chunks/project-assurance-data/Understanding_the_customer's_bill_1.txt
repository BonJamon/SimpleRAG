Common Customer Questions
Here is a list of common questions customers might have about their bill and how to address them:


Why is my bill higher than last month?
Check the Usage Details section for any overage charges or additional services that may have been used. Also, review the Promotions and Discounts section to see if any promotional credits have ended.


What are these additional fees?
Direct the customer to the Taxes and Fees section where they will find a detailed breakdown of all additional charges.


How can I reduce my bill?
Suggest the customer review their current plan and usage. They might benefit from a different plan that better suits their usage habits. Additionally, inform them about any ongoing promotions that they might not be aware of.


I made a payment, why isn't it showing?
Payments can take a few business days to process. Verify the payment date and check the Account Summary for any pending payments. If the payment was made recently, advise the customer to wait a few more days.
