Troubleshooting Steps

Check Signal Strength: Verify the Wi-Fi signal strength on the affected device. Move closer to the router to see if the signal improves.
Inspect Router Placement: Ensure the router is positioned in a central location, elevated, and free from obstructions.
Reduce Interference: Keep the router away from other electronic devices that may cause interference.
Update Firmware: Check for and install any available updates for the router's firmware.
Reboot the Router: Power cycle the router by turning it off, waiting 30 seconds, and turning it back on.
Change Wi-Fi Channel: In the router settings, try changing the Wi-Fi channel to avoid interference from other nearby networks.
Upgrade Equipment: Consider upgrading to a newer router that supports the latest Wi-Fi standards for better performance.
Add an Extender or Mesh Network: Use a Wi-Fi extender or mesh network system to improve coverage in larger areas.
