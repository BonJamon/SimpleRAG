Check if the customer is connected to the router’s network. Verify the router’s IP address and ensure the customer is using the correct login credentials.


Firmware update fails
Ensure the customer has downloaded the correct firmware file for their router model. Verify that the file is not corrupted, and suggest re-downloading if necessary.


Important Considerations

Advise customers to back up their current router settings before proceeding with the firmware update.
Firmware updates should be performed with a stable power supply to avoid interruptions.
Warn customers that firmware updates may reset the router to default settings, and they may need to reconfigure their network settings afterward.
