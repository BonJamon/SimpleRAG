Locate the DHCP Settings: Navigate to the appropriate section often labeled as "Network Settings," "LAN Setup," or "DHCP Settings." The terminology may vary depending on the router.
Adjust the IP Address Range: Here, users can often specify the range of IP addresses that the DHCP server can assign. Ensure they know to:

                
Set an appropriate range to include enough IP addresses for their network.
Avoid overlapping with static IP addresses to prevent conflicts.


Reserve IP Addresses: If a customer wants certain devices to always receive the same IP address, guide them to create DHCP reservations which map specific IP addresses to the devices' MAC addresses.
Save and Reboot: After making changes, instruct the customer to save the settings and reboot the router to apply the new configuration.
