Network Optimization

Wired Connection: Use a wired Ethernet connection instead of Wi-Fi for a more stable and faster connection.
Router Placement: Place the router in an open space and as close to the gaming device as possible.
Quality of Service (QoS): Enable QoS on the router to prioritize gaming traffic over other types of internet traffic.



Additional Tips

Close unnecessary background applications to free up system resources for gaming.
Regularly clean and maintain hardware to prevent overheating and dust accumulation.
Consider using game booster software that can optimize system settings for gaming performance.
