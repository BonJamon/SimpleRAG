Steps to Troubleshoot Slow Video Streaming


Check Internet Connection
Ensure that the customer's internet connection is stable and meets the minimum speed requirements for video streaming.

Ask the customer to perform a speed test at Speedtest.net.
Verify that the download speed is at least 5 Mbps for HD streaming and 25 Mbps for 4K streaming.



Router and Modem Status
Check the status and performance of the router and modem.

Ask the customer to restart their router and modem by unplugging them for 30 seconds and then plugging them back in.
Ensure that the router firmware is up to date. Refer to the manufacturer's website for update instructions if needed.



Reduce Network Congestion
Identify and minimize other devices or applications that may be consuming significant bandwidth on the network.

Ask the customer if other devices are streaming or downloading large files. If so, try pausing these activities.
Recommend switching to a wired Ethernet connection if the customer is using Wi-Fi, as this can provide a more stable connection.



Device Performance
Ensure the customer's device is capable of streaming video efficiently.
