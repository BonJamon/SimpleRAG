What should I do if I receive an overage notification?
If a customer receives an overage notification, they should consider reducing data usage or upgrading their plan to avoid additional charges in the future.



Steps to Assist Customers

Verify the customer's details and check their data usage history in the system.
Explain the type of notification they received and the reason for it.
Offer guidance on managing data usage, such as using Wi-Fi where available and monitoring data consumption through the QuickConnect app.
Provide information on data plans and suggest an upgrade if the customer frequently exceeds their data limit.
If requested, guide the customer on how to opt out of notifications via their account settings.

Note: Always be empathetic and patient when discussing data overage charges, as this may be a sensitive topic for some customers.
