Usage




Ping

Traceroute
Displays the route taken by packets across the network and measures each hop's latency.





Steps to Improve Network Latency

Upgrade to higher-quality networking hardware.
Reduce the number of intermediary devices on the network.
Use wired connections instead of wireless where possible.
Ensure your network is not congested by unnecessary traffic.
Seek professional advice for advanced network optimization.
