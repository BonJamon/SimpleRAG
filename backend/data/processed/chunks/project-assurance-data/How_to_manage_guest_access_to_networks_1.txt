Login to the Router's Admin Interface: Instruct the customer to open a web browser and enter the router's IP address (commonly 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1) in the address bar. They will need to enter their admin username and password.
Access the Guest Network Settings: Once logged in, guide the customer to locate the section in the router interface labeled "Guest Network" or "Guest Access."
Enable Guest Network: Instruct the customer to turn on or enable the guest network. This may involve simply toggling a switch or checking a box.
Set Up Network Name (SSID) and Password: Help the customer to set a unique and recognizable name for the guest network. They should also configure a strong password to secure guest access.
Configure Additional Settings: Based on the customer's needs, they can configure additional settings such as bandwidth limits, access duration, and restrictions on accessing the main network. Ensure they save all changes.
Save and Test the Setup: Instruct the customer to save the settings and test the guest network connectivity by connecting a device to the guest network using the SSID and password set earlier.
