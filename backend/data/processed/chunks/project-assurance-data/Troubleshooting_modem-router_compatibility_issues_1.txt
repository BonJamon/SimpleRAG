Update Firmware

Check if there are firmware updates available for both the modem and the router.
Guide the customer through updating the firmware if necessary.


Restart Devices

Instruct the customer to power cycle the modem by unplugging it, waiting 30 seconds, and plugging it back in.
Do the same for the router after the modem has restarted.


Check Router Settings

Ensure that the router’s WAN settings are set to acquire an IP address automatically (DHCP).
If using a static IP, verify that the settings are correct as provided by QuickConnect.


Perform a Reset

If the issue persists, guide the customer through performing a factory reset of both the modem and router.
After the reset, reconfigure the devices as per QuickConnect instructions.


Escalate the Issue

If all steps fail, escalate the issue to the technical support team for advanced troubleshooting.
