Configuration Setting
Description
Recommendation




Wireless Channel
Channels used by the router for wireless communication.
Select a less congested channel (1, 6, or 11) using built-in tools or third-party apps.


Bandwidth
Amount of data that can be transmitted at once.
Use 20/40 MHz for 2.4 GHz networks and 80 MHz for 5 GHz networks for better performance.


QoS (Quality of Service)
Prioritizes bandwidth for critical applications and devices.
Enable QoS settings and prioritize streaming, gaming, and VoIP services.



3. Configuring Switches

Enable VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) to segment network traffic and improve security and performance.
Configure link aggregation to combine multiple network connections for increased bandwidth and redundancy.
Utilize Quality of Service (QoS) to prioritize critical data traffic.
