2. Check Device Compatibility
Ensure the customer's device meets the minimum system requirements for the telehealth platform. Update the device’s operating system if necessary.

Instruct the customer to restart their modem, router, and the device they are using for telehealth.


4. Update Telehealth App
Ensure the customer is using the latest version of the telehealth application by checking for updates through their device’s app store.

If the customer has a firewall or antivirus software, guide them to temporarily adjust the settings to allow the telehealth service.

For a more stable connection, recommend the customer use a wired Ethernet connection instead of Wi-Fi.

If issues persist, suggest the customer contact their telehealth service provider for additional assistance or alternative solutions.
