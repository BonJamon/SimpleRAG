Setting Up Call Forwarding

Choose the appropriate call forwarding option based on the customer's needs.
Instruct the customer to dial the respective Activation Code followed by the phone number to forward calls to, and then #.
If the customer needs to deactivate call forwarding, instruct them to dial the respective Deactivation Code.

Example
If a customer wants to forward all their calls to (123) 456-7890 unconditionally, they would dial:
*21*1234567890#
To deactivate, they would dial:
#21#
Troubleshooting

Ensure the customer is entering the code correctly and including the '#' at the end.
Check that the customer’s account is in good standing and that their plan includes call forwarding features.
Advise the customer to restart their phone if call forwarding is not working as expected.
In case of persistent issues, escalate the problem to the technical support team for further investigation.
