Customer Troubleshooting Tips for Network Congestion
When customers experience issues due to network congestion, guide them through the following steps:

Check Network Status: Verify if there are known issues or maintenance activities affecting the network.
Reduce Bandwidth Usage: Suggest limiting the use of high-bandwidth applications or devices, particularly during peak usage times.
Restart Devices: Instruct customers to restart their modem/router and devices to potentially resolve temporary issues.
Upgrade Plan: If congestion issues persist, recommend upgrading to a plan with higher bandwidth limits.
