3. Using Range Extenders and Mesh Networks
For larger homes or areas with poor coverage, range extenders and mesh networks are effective solutions:

Description


Range Extenders
Devices that amplify the existing Wi-Fi signal. They should be placed halfway between the router and the area with poor signal.


Mesh Networks
A system of interconnected nodes that provide seamless Wi-Fi coverage throughout the home. Mesh nodes communicate with each other to ensure a strong signal.


4. Changing Wi-Fi Channels
Wi-Fi interference from other networks can degrade performance. Guide customers to:

Log in to their router’s settings and change to a less congested Wi-Fi channel.
Use tools like Wi-Fi analyzers to identify the best channel available.

5. Antenna Upgrades and External Options
External antennas and other devices can also help improve signal strength:

Replace the router's antenna with a high-gain antenna to boost signal strength.
Consider using powerline adapters that use electrical wiring to extend the network.

6. Minimizing Interference
Reducing interference from other devices can help improve Wi-Fi performance:

Keep the router away from microwave ovens, cordless phones, and baby monitors.
Use a Wi-Fi range analyzer to identify and mitigate sources of interference.
