3. Using the Speed Test Tool

Access the tool at quickconnect.com/speedtest.
Recommend that customers connect their device directly to the modem via an Ethernet cable for the most accurate results.
Instruct customers to click "Start Test" and wait for the results. They can see their download and upload speeds and some basic diagnostics.
If issues are detected, suggest restarting the modem and running the test again.
