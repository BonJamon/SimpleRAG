QuickConnect Customer Service Guide: Bandwidth Throttling



QuickConnect Customer Service Guide
Understanding and Assisting with Bandwidth Throttling
Bandwidth throttling is a process where an Internet Service Provider (ISP) intentionally limits the internet speed of certain users or types of traffic. This can affect the customer’s experience by slowing down the internet when streaming, downloading files, or performing other online activities.

Note: Always verify the customer’s account and network settings before concluding that throttling is the issue.

    
Common Reasons for Bandwidth Throttling

Exceeding data caps on certain plans.
Network congestion during peak hours.
Use of high bandwidth applications like streaming services or large file downloads.
Fair usage policies that distribute bandwidth evenly among all users.

How to Identify Bandwidth Throttling

Check recent data usage on the customer's account.
Compare the current internet speed with the plan speed. Use tools like Speedtest.
Ask about intermittent slowdowns, especially during specific times of day.
Verify if throttling is mentioned in the service plan or provider’s policies.
