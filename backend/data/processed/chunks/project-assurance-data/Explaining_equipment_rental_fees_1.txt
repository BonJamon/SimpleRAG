Can I use my own equipment to avoid these fees?
Customers are free to use their own compatible equipment; however, doing so may affect the level of technical support we can offer. Customers should ensure their equipment meets QuickConnect's technical requirements.


What happens if my rented equipment stops working?
If any rented equipment becomes faulty, QuickConnect will provide a replacement at no additional cost, as long as the issue isn’t due to misuse or physical damage by the customer.


How to Address Disputes
If a customer disputes the equipment rental fees, review their billing history and confirm the charges. If an error is found, correct it and inform the customer. If no error is found, explain the necessity and benefits of renting our equipment while remaining empathetic to the customer's situation.
