    <h3>Step 1: Identify the Problem</h3>
    <p>Ask the customer the following questions to better understand the issue:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What game are you experiencing connectivity issues with?</li>
        <li>Are you receiving any error messages?</li>

        <strong>Tip:</strong> Taking detailed notes during this step can help in accurately diagnosing the problem.
    </div>

    <h3>Step 2: Check Basic Connectivity</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ask the customer to try browsing a website to confirm their internet connection is working.</li>
        <li>Ensure the customer’s modem and router are powered on and the connections are secure.</li>
        <li>Advise the customer to reboot their router and modem to refresh their connection.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 3: Verify Game Server Status</h3>

        <li>Check community forums for reports of similar issues from other players.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 4: Network Configuration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensure the customer’s NAT type is set to "Open" or "Moderate" for optimal performance. Provide guidance on how to check and change NAT settings if necessary.</li>
        <li>Advise the customer to connect their gaming device directly to the router with an Ethernet cable if they are using Wi-Fi.</li>
        <li>Suggest disabling any network features that might be causing interference (e.g., QoS, firewall settings).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 5: Advanced Troubleshooting</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Check and configure port forwarding settings based on the game's requirements.</li>
        <li>Verify and update firmware for the customer’s router.</li>
