    <h1>Understanding Early Termination Fees</h1>
    
    <p>Early termination fees (ETFs) are charges that customers may incur if they decide to end their contract with QuickConnect before the agreed-upon term is complete. This documentation helps customer service agents understand and explain these fees to customers clearly.</p>

    <h2>What are Early Termination Fees?</h2>
    <p>Early termination fees are applicable to customers who terminate their service agreement before the contract term ends. These fees are intended to offset the cost of the discounted equipment and services provided at the beginning of the contract.</p>

    <h2>When are Early Termination Fees Applied?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Canceling the service before the end of the contract term.</li>
        <li>Switching to a different service plan before the term is over.</li>
        <li>Failing to adhere to the terms of the agreement.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How are Early Termination Fees Calculated?</h2>
    <p>The calculation of early termination fees depends on the type of contract and the number of months remaining in the contract period. Below is a detailed table to guide you:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Contract Type</th>
                <th>Initial Termination Fee</th>
                <th>Monthly Reduction</th>
                <th>Note</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>12-Month Agreement</td>
                <td>$120</td>
                <td>$10 per month</td>
                <td>Fee reduces by $10 for each month completed.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>24-Month Agreement</td>
                <td>$240</td>
                <td>$10 per month</td>
                <td>Fee reduces by $10 for each month completed.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>36-Month Agreement</td>
                <td>$360</td>
                <td>$10 per month</td>
                <td>Fee reduces by $10 for each month completed.</td>
            </tr>
