    <h1>Guidelines for Extending Wi-Fi Range</h1>
    
    <p>Providing customers with effective strategies to extend their Wi-Fi range can significantly enhance their internet experience. Below are several methods and tools that customers can use to improve their Wi-Fi coverage:</p>
    
    <h2>1. Positioning the Router</h2>
    <p>The placement of the Wi-Fi router plays a crucial role in signal strength. Advise customers to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Place the router in a central location to ensure even coverage.</li>
        <li>Avoid placing the router next to large metal objects or appliances that can interfere with the signal.</li>
        <li>Elevate the router by placing it on a high shelf or mounting it on the wall.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Upgrading the Router</h2>
    <p>Older routers may not support the latest Wi-Fi standards. Recommend that customers consider:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Upgrading to a router that supports <span class="highlight">Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac)</span> or <span class="highlight">Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax)</span> for better performance and range.</li>
        <li>Using a dual-band or tri-band router to alleviate network congestion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Using Range Extenders and Mesh Networks</h2>
    <p>For larger homes or areas with poor coverage, range extenders and mesh networks are effective solutions:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Solution</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Range Extenders</td>
            <td>Devices that amplify the existing Wi-Fi signal. They should be placed halfway between the router and the area with poor signal.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Mesh Networks</td>
            <td>A system of interconnected nodes that provide seamless Wi-Fi coverage throughout the home. Mesh nodes communicate with each other to ensure a strong signal.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>4. Changing Wi-Fi Channels</h2>
    <p>Wi-Fi interference from other networks can degrade performance. Guide customers to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Log in to their router’s settings and change to a less congested Wi-Fi channel.</li>
        <li>Use tools like Wi-Fi analyzers to identify the best channel available.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Antenna Upgrades and External Options</h2>
    <p>External antennas and other devices can also help improve signal strength:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Replace the router's antenna with a high-gain antenna to boost signal strength.</li>
        <li>Consider using powerline adapters that use electrical wiring to extend the network.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Minimizing Interference</h2>
    <p>Reducing interference from other devices can help improve Wi-Fi performance:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Keep the router away from microwave ovens, cordless phones, and baby monitors.</li>
        <li>Use a Wi-Fi range analyzer to identify and mitigate sources of interference.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Social Media and Support Contact</h2>
