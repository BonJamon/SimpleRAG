    <h1>How to Configure MAC Address Filtering</h1>
    
    <p>MAC address filtering is a security feature that allows you to control which devices can connect to your network based on their MAC addresses. Follow these steps to configure MAC address filtering on your QuickConnect router:</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>What is a MAC address?</strong> - A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications on the physical network segment.</li>
        <li><strong>Can MAC address filtering be bypassed?</strong> - While MAC address filtering provides an additional layer of security, it can be bypassed by individuals who are able to spoof (fake) a MAC address.</li>
        <li><strong>Why is my device unable to connect after configuring MAC address filtering?</strong> - Ensure that the device's MAC address is correctly entered in the allow or deny list. Double-check for any typographical errors.</li>
    </ul>
