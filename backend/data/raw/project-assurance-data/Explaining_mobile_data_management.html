    <h2>Explaining Mobile Data Management</h2>
    <p>Welcome, QuickConnect customer service agents! This document will help you assist customers with queries related to mobile data management. Mobile data management involves monitoring and controlling the usage of data on a mobile device. Below, you will find detailed information on this topic to guide you through customer inquiries seamlessly.</p>
    
    <h3>Understanding Mobile Data</h3>
    <p>Mobile data allows customers to access the internet on their mobile devices when they are not connected to Wi-Fi. This includes activities like browsing the web, using apps, streaming video and audio, and downloading files.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Features of Mobile Data Management</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Usage Tracking:</strong> Monitoring how much data has been used within a billing cycle.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Limits:</strong> Setting up thresholds to alert customers when they are nearing their data limit.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Saver Mode:</strong> Enabling settings that reduce data consumption by:
            <ul>
                <li>Restricting background data usage.</li>
                <li>Compressing images and videos.</li>
                <li>Reducing the quality of streaming media.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Data Usage Reports:</strong> Viewing detailed reports on data usage per app or service.</li>
    </ul>

        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>How can I check my data usage?</td>
            <td>Advise the customer to go to their device settings and look for "Data Usage" or "Mobile Data" options. They can view their current usage there. Alternatively, direct them to our QuickConnect App for detailed data reports.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>How do I set up data usage alerts?</td>
            <td>Guide them to the "Data Usage" settings on their mobile device, where they can set data limits and thresholds. Notifications will alert them as they approach their set data limit.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>What is Data Saver mode and how do I enable it?</td>
            <td>Explain that Data Saver mode reduces the amount of data used by restricting background activities and lowering multimedia quality. They can enable Data Saver mode from the "Data Usage" settings.</td>

            <td>Can I see which apps are using the most data?</td>
            <td>Yes, customers can view app-specific data usage in the "Data Usage" settings on their mobile devices. This helps identify any apps that might be consuming excessive data.</td>
