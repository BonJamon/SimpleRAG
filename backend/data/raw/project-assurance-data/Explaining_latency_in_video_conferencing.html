        <h1>Understanding Latency in Video Conferencing</h1>
        <p>Latency in video conferencing can significantly impact the quality of communication. This document will help QuickConnect customer service agents understand the concept of latency and how to explain it to customers effectively.</p>
        
        <h2>What is Latency?</h2>
        <p>Latency, in the context of video conferencing, is the delay between the time data is sent and when it is received. This delay can cause communication to feel out-of-sync, leading to potential confusion and frustration during video calls.</p>

        <h2>Common Causes of Latency</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Network Congestion:</strong> High traffic on the network can slow down data transmission.</li>
            <li><strong>Distance:</strong> The farther the data has to travel, the higher the latency, due to the time it takes for signals to travel between locations.</li>
            <li><strong>Hardware Limitations:</strong> Outdated or low-performance hardware can contribute to delays.</li>
            <li><strong>Software Issues:</strong> Bugs or inefficiencies in the video conferencing software can also be a source of latency.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Impact of Latency</h2>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Latency Range</th>
                    <th>Perceived Impact</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>0 - 150 milliseconds</td>
                    <td>Low latency; generally not noticeable and does not affect communication.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>150 - 300 milliseconds</td>
                    <td>Moderate latency; slight delay may be noticed but doesn't significantly affect conversation flow.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>300 - 600 milliseconds</td>
                    <td>High latency; noticeable delay, which can impact the fluidity of conversation.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>> 600 milliseconds</td>
                    <td>Very high latency; significant delay causing interruptions in communication, making it challenging to engage in effective conversation.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2>Tips to Minimize Latency</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use a Wired Connection:</strong> Whenever possible, use a wired connection instead of Wi-Fi to reduce network congestion.</li>
            <li><strong>Upgrade Internet Plan:</strong> Ensure the customer has a high-speed internet plan suitable for video conferencing.</li>
            <li><strong>Close Unnecessary Applications:</strong> Closing other applications that use bandwidth can help reduce latency.</li>
            <li><strong>Update Software and Hardware:</strong> Keeping video conferencing software and hardware up-to-date ensures optimal performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Position Near Router:</strong> If using Wi-Fi, advise the customer to be as close to the router as possible to minimize interference.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Address Customer Concerns</h2>
        <p>When a customer reports issues with latency, follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Listen to the customer's description of the
