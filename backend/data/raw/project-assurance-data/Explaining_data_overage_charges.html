    <h1>Understanding Data Overage Charges</h1>
    <p>Customers sometimes exceed their data plan limits, which can result in additional charges. It is important to clearly explain these overage charges to our customers so they can understand their bills and how to avoid extra fees in the future.</p>
   
    <h2>What are Data Overage Charges?</h2>
    <p>Data overage charges occur when a customer uses more data than their plan allows within a billing cycle. These charges are applied to their account based on the extra amount of data consumed beyond their plan limit.</p>
    
    <h2>How to Explain Overage Charges</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Review the Customer’s Plan:</strong> Confirm the data limit included in their plan.</li>
        <li><strong>Check Usage:</strong> Look at the amount of data the customer has used during the billing cycle.</li>
        <li><strong>Calculate Overage:</strong> Determine the amount of data exceeded and apply the overage rate.</li>
        <li><strong>Communicate Clearly:</strong> Explain the overage in a simple and clear manner.</li>
        <li><strong>Provide Options:</strong> Offer tips on how to avoid future overages or suggest plan upgrades.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Example Overage Charge Calculation</h2>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Plan</th>
                <th>Monthly Data Limit</th>
                <th>Used Data</th>
                <th>Overage Rate</th>
                <th>Total Overage Charge</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Basic Plan</td>
                <td>5 GB</td>
                <td>6.5 GB</td>
                <td>$10 per GB</td>
                <td>$15 (1.5 GB x $10)</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
