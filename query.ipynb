      "   - Wait for about 10-30 seconds.\n",
      "   - Turn it back on.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Check Connections:\n",
      "   - Ensure the router is properly connected to power and your modem.\n",
      "   - Verify that cables are securely plugged in.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Access Router Settings:\n",
      "   - Connect a computer to the router via Ethernet or Wi-Fi.\n",
      "   - Open a web browser and enter the router's IP address (commonly 192.168.0.1, 192.168.1.1, or 10.0.0.1).\n",
      "   - Log in using the default credentials found on the router sticker or manual (e.g., username: admin, password: admin).\n",

      "4. Update Firmware:\n",
      "   - In the router settings, check for firmware updates and install the latest version.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Reset to Factory Settings:\n",
      "   - If login credentials don't work or issues persist, press and hold the reset button on the router for 10-15 seconds to restore factory defaults.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Configure Basic Settings:\n",
      "   - Set your Wi-Fi network name (SSID) and a strong password.\n",
      "   - Ensure security mode is set to WPA2.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Troubleshoot Signal Issues:\n",
      "   - Place the router in a central, elevated location away from electronic devices that may cause interference.\n",
      "   - Change the Wi-Fi channel in the router settings to avoid congestion.\n",
      "\n",

      "1. Verify Hardware Connections:\n",

      "   - After the modem restarts, do the same for the router.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Access Router Settings:\n",
      "   - Connect your computer or device to the router via Ethernet or Wi-Fi.\n",
      "   - Open a web browser and enter the router’s IP address (commonly 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1) in the address bar.\n",
      "   - Log in using the default username and password (often found on a sticker on the router).\n",

      "4. Check Router Settings:\n",
      "   - Ensure the router’s WAN settings are set to acquire an IP address automatically (DHCP).\n",
      "   - If using a static IP, verify the settings are correct.\n",

      "6. Reset Router:\n",
      "   - If issues persist, perform a factory reset by pressing and holding the reset button on the router for 10-15 seconds.\n",
      "   - Reconfigure the router settings after the reset.\n",

      "7. Additional Steps for Wi-Fi Issues:\n",
