 and External Options
External antennas and other devices can also help improve signal strength:
Replace the router's antenna with a high-gain antenna to boost signal strength.
Consider using powerline adapters that use electrical wiring to extend the network.
6. Minimizing Interference
Reducing interference from other devices can help improve Wi-Fi performance:
Keep the router away from microwave ovens, cordless phones, and baby monitors.
Use a Wi-Fi range analyzer to identify and mitigate sources of interference.
