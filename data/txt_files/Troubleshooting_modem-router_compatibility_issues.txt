QuickConnect Customer Service: Modem-Router Compatibility Troubleshooting



QuickConnect Customer Service Guide
Troubleshooting Modem-Router Compatibility Issues
This guide will help customer service agents troubleshoot common modem-router compatibility issues faced by QuickConnect customers.
Common Indicators of Compatibility Issues

Internet connection drops intermittently.
Router fails to acquire an IP address from the modem.
Slow internet speeds despite a fast plan.
Unable to access certain websites or services.

Steps for Troubleshooting

Verify Hardware Connections

Ensure that the modem is properly connected to the incoming internet line (coaxial, DSL, fiber, etc.).
Ensure that the router is properly connected to the modem using an Ethernet cable (modem to router’s WAN port).
Check that both devices are powered on.


Check Compatibility

Verify that the customer's modem and router are compatible with each other and with the QuickConnect service.
Refer to the Compatibility Chart provided below.


Update Firmware

Check if there are firmware updates available for both the modem and the router.
Guide the customer through updating the firmware if necessary.


Restart Devices

Instruct the customer to power cycle the modem by unplugging it, waiting 30 seconds, and plugging it back in.
Do the same for the router after the modem has restarted.


Check Router Settings

Ensure that the router’s WAN settings are set to acquire an IP address automatically (DHCP).
If using a static IP, verify that the settings are correct as provided by QuickConnect.


Perform a Reset

If the issue persists, guide the customer through performing a factory reset of both the modem and router.
After the reset, reconfigure the devices as per QuickConnect instructions.


Escalate the Issue

If all steps fail, escalate the issue to the technical support team for advanced troubleshooting.
