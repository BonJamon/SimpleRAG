    <h2>Advanced Troubleshooting</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Check if there are any ongoing outages or known issues with the streaming service by visiting their official support page.</li>
        <li>Advise the customer to disable VPN or proxies, as these can sometimes interfere with streaming services.</li>

        <li>Suggest limiting the number of devices using the same network to reduce bandwidth competition.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If the issue persists despite troubleshooting, escalate the case to technical support. Collect the following information to assist the technical team:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Customer's account information, including subscription details.</li>
        <li>Description of the issue, including error messages if any.</li>
        <li>Details about the customer's device (make, model, operating system).</li>
