    <h2>Assisting with Landline Troubleshooting</h2>

    <p>Welcome to the guide for assisting customers with landline troubleshooting. This document is designed to provide you with the steps and information needed to effectively solve common landline issues.</p>

    <h3>Common Landline Issues</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>No Dial Tone</li>
        <li>Static or Noise on the Line</li>
        <li>Can't Receive Calls</li>
        <li>Can't Make Outgoing Calls</li>
        <li>Intermittent Service</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Troubleshooting Steps</h3>
    <p>Follow these steps to help resolve the customer's landline issues:</p>

    <h4>1. No Dial Tone</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensure all telephone cords are plugged in securely.</li>
        <li>Check if the phone itself is working by trying another handset.</li>
        <li>Ensure there are no outages in the customer’s area. You can check this in the system dashboard.</li>
        <li>If the problem persists, escalate to technical support.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Static or Noise on the Line</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Make sure all equipment, like modems and fax machines, are properly filtered.</li>
        <li>Check the line with a different phone to rule out a faulty device.</li>
        <li>Ask if electrical equipment or large metal objects are near the phone; these can cause interference.</li>
        <li>Suggest the customer to disconnect and reconnect all cords.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Can't Receive Calls</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Confirm the phone ringer is turned on.</li>
        <li>Verify that call forwarding is not engaged.</li>
        <li>Check with the customer if they have enabled Do Not Disturb.</li>
        <li>Ensure the line is not shared with another device such as a DSL modem.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4. Can't Make Outgoing Calls</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensure there is no call bar or block enabled on the line.</li>
        <li>Check if the dialing pattern is correct, especially for international numbers.</li>
        <li>Test using another phone to rule out equipment issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>5. Intermittent Service</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Inquire about any recent changes to the home network setup or new devices which might be interfering.</li>
        <li>Check for any wiring issues or loose connections inside the home.</li>
        <li>Perform a line test if possible to identify external faults.</li>
        <li>If the issue is not resolved, escalate to a higher tier of technical support.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Escalation Procedures</h3>
    <p>If the customer's issue persists after troubleshooting, follow these escalation steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Document all the troubleshooting steps taken and the customer's responses.</li>
        <li>Provide a detailed description of the issue and any pertinent data on the system.</li>
        <li>Contact the next level of technical support and provide all gathered information.</li>
        <li>Ensure the customer is updated on the status and expected resolution time.</li>
    </ol>
