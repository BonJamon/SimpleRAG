    <h2>Troubleshooting Common Issues</h2>
    <p>If a customer reports issues with their internet connection, the status lights on the modem can provide vital clues. Here are some common scenarios and troubleshooting steps:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Power Light:</strong> Verify that the power cord is securely plugged into both the modem and the electrical outlet. Try a different outlet if necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>Downstream/Upstream Light Amber:</strong> Check the coaxial cable connection and ensure it’s tightly secured. Restart the modem. If the problem persists, it might be an issue with the service provider.</li>
        <li><strong>No Online Light:</strong> Restart the modem. Check if there’s a known outage in the area. If the online light remains off, try resetting the modem to factory settings (refer to the modem’s manual for instructions).</li>
        <li><strong>No LAN/WAN Light:</strong> Ensure the Ethernet cable is correctly plugged in at both ends. Confirm that the connected device (e.g., a PC or router) is turned on and functioning properly.</li>
    </ul>
