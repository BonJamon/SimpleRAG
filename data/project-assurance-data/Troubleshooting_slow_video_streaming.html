        <h1>QuickConnect - Troubleshooting Slow Video Streaming</h1>
        <p>This document provides guidance on how to assist customers who are experiencing slow video streaming issues. Follow these steps to diagnose and resolve the problem efficiently.</p>
        
        <h2>Steps to Troubleshoot Slow Video Streaming</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Check Internet Connection</h3>
                <p>Ensure that the customer's internet connection is stable and meets the minimum speed requirements for video streaming.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ask the customer to perform a speed test at <a href="https://speedtest.net" target="_blank">Speedtest.net</a>.</li>
                    <li>Verify that the download speed is at least 5 Mbps for HD streaming and 25 Mbps for 4K streaming.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Router and Modem Status</h3>
                <p>Check the status and performance of the router and modem.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ask the customer to restart their router and modem by unplugging them for 30 seconds and then plugging them back in.</li>
                    <li>Ensure that the router firmware is up to date. Refer to the manufacturer's website for update instructions if needed.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Reduce Network Congestion</h3>
                <p>Identify and minimize other devices or applications that may be consuming significant bandwidth on the network.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ask the customer if other devices are streaming or downloading large files. If so, try pausing these activities.</li>
                    <li>Recommend switching to a wired Ethernet connection if the customer is using Wi-Fi, as this can provide a more stable connection.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Device Performance</h3>
                <p>Ensure the customer's device is capable of streaming video efficiently.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Verify that the customer's device and streaming app are both updated to the latest versions.</li>
                    <li>Suggest closing other applications running in the background that may affect performance.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Streaming Service Issues</h3>
                <p>Determine if the issue is related to the streaming service itself.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Check if the streaming service is experiencing widespread issues. This can be done by visiting websites such as <a href="https://downdetector.com" target="_blank">DownDetector</a>.</li>
                    <li>Ask if the customer experiences slow streaming on multiple streaming platforms, which may indicate a broader issue.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
