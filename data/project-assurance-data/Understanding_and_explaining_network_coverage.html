    <h1>Understanding and Explaining Network Coverage</h1>

    <p>As a QuickConnect customer service agent, it is vital to provide clear and accurate information regarding network coverage. This document will guide you through key points to explain network coverage effectively to customers.</p>

    <h2>Key Terms</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Network Coverage:</strong> The geographical area where the company's network services (voice, data, and messaging) are available.</li>
        <li><strong>4G/5G:</strong> The latest generations of mobile communication technologies offering faster data speeds and more reliable connections.</li>
        <li><strong>Roaming:</strong> The ability to use mobile services outside the primary coverage area, often involving agreements with other network providers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Understanding Network Areas</h2>
    
    <p>Network coverage is generally divided into three types of areas:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Urban Areas:</strong> Typically have the best coverage with high-speed data and strong signal strength.</li>
        <li><strong>Suburban Areas:</strong> Generally have good coverage, though some areas might experience varying signal strength.</li>
        <li><strong>Rural Areas:</strong> Coverage can be limited and often depends on proximity to network towers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Customer Queries and Responses</h2>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Customer Query</th>
            <th>Suggested Response</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Why is my signal weak?</td>
            <td>Signal strength can vary due to factors such as distance from network towers, physical obstructions like buildings, and weather conditions. Checking our coverage map can help locate the nearest tower.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="highlight">
            <td>Can I get 5G in my area?</td>
            <td>Please provide your location or use our online coverage map to check if 5G services are available in your area. We are continuously working to expand our 5G network.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>What do I do if I have no coverage?</td>
            <td>First, ensure your device is set to the correct network mode. If the issue persists, consider restarting your device or contacting us for further support. In some cases, a signal booster may be beneficial.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="highlight">
            <td>How does roaming work?</td>
            <td>When you travel outside our primary coverage area, your phone may connect to partnering networks. Note that additional charges may apply, and it's best to check our roaming plans for detailed information.</td>
        </tr>
