    <h1>Understanding Fair Usage Policies</h1>
    <p>As a customer service agent at QuickConnect, it's essential to understand and effectively communicate our fair usage policies to our customers. These policies help ensure that all customers receive quality service by preventing any single user from consuming an excessive amount of network resources. This document provides an overview of our fair usage policies and guidelines to assist customers.</p>
    
    <h2>What is Fair Usage Policy (FUP)?</h2>
    <p>A Fair Usage Policy (FUP) is put in place to ensure that all customers have equitable access to network services. It prevents high-usage customers from impacting the experience of others by imposing reasonable limits on data usage. This ensures network stability and quality for all users.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Elements of QuickConnect's Fair Usage Policy</h2>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Element</th>
                <th>Details</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Data Cap</td>
                <td>Each mobile plan has a data cap after which data speed may be reduced.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Speed Reduction</td>
                <td>Once the data cap is reached, customers will experience reduced internet speed.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Extra Charges</td>
                <td>No extra charges for exceeding usage limits, but speed will be throttled.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Monitoring</td>
                <td>Data usage is monitored and customers are notified when they approach or exceed their limits.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    
    <h2>Tips for Communicating FUP to Customers</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Be Clear and Concise:</strong> Explain the fair usage policy in simple terms. Avoid jargon.</li>
        <li><strong>Provide Examples:</strong> Use examples to illustrate what exceeding the data cap means for the customer's service.</li>
        <li><strong>Offer Solutions:</strong> Suggest plans with higher data limits if customers frequently exceed their current plan's cap.</li>
        <li><strong>Be Empathetic:</strong> Understand that customers may feel frustrated by speed reductions, and show empathy in your responses.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Common Customer Queries about FUP</h2>
