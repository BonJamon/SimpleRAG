Fair Usage Policies
Understanding Fair Usage Policies
As a customer service agent at QuickConnect, it's essential to understand and effectively communicate our fair usage policies to our customers. These policies help ensure that all customers receive quality service by preventing any single user from consuming an excessive amount of network resources. This document provides an overview of our fair usage policies and guidelines to assist customers.
What is Fair Usage Policy (FUP)?
A Fair Usage Policy (FUP) is put in place to ensure that all customers have equitable access to network services. It prevents high-usage customers from impacting the experience of others by imposing reasonable limits on data usage. This ensures network stability and quality for all users.
