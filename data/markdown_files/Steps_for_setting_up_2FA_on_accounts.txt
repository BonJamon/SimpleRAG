QuickConnect Customer Support Guide
Steps for Setting Up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your QuickConnect account by requiring not only a password and username but also something that only the user has on them, i.e., a piece of information only they should know or have immediately to hand - such as a physical token.
Benefits of Setting Up 2FA:

Enhanced security for your account
Protection against unauthorized access
Peace of mind knowing your personal data is safer

Steps to Set Up 2FA:


Login to Your QuickConnect Account:
            Navigate to the QuickConnect login page and enter your username and password.
        

Access Account Settings:
            Once logged in, click on your profile icon in the top right corner and select "Account Settings" from the dropdown menu.
        

Navigate to Security Settings:
            In the Account Settings menu, select "Security" to access your security settings.
        

Enable Two-Factor Authentication:
            In the Security section, find the Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) option. Click the "Enable 2FA" button.
        

Choose Authentication Method:
            You will be prompted to choose an authentication method. Choose between using a mobile authentication app (e.g., Google Authenticator) or receiving codes via SMS.
        

Set Up the Authentication Method:
            Follow the on-screen instructions to set up the chosen authentication method:
            
Mobile App: Scan the QR code provided with your mobile authentication app, then enter the verification code generated by the app.
SMS: Enter your mobile phone number to receive a verification code via SMS, then enter the code on the QuickConnect website.



Verify and Confirm:
            Once the authentication method is set up, enter the code generated by the app or received via SMS to verify the setup. Click "Confirm" to complete the process.
