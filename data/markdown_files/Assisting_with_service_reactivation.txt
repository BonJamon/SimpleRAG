Assisting with Service Reactivation
Customers may need to reactivate their telecommunications service for a variety of reasons, such as an overdue bill or temporary suspension of service. Follow these guidelines to assist customers effectively.
Steps for Reactivating Service
Verify the Customer's Identity:
Ask for the customer's full name.
Request the account number or phone number associated with the QuickConnect service.
Ask for an additional identifier (e.g., last payment amount or date).
Check the Account Status:
Log in to the QuickConnect Customer Management System (CMS).
Navigate to the customer's account summary page.
Locate the service status section and note any alerts or holds.
Determine Reactivation Requirements:
If there is an overdue balance, inform the customer of the payment required to reactivate the service.
Provide payment options (e.g., online payment, payment by phone).
Process the Payment:
If the customer is ready to make a payment, walk them through the payment process.
Confirm receipt of payment and update the account status accordingly.
Reactivation Confirmation:
Once payment is confirmed, navigate to the reactivation section in the CMS.
Submit the reactivation request and note the confirmation details.
Inform the customer that their service has been reactivated and provide any additional instructions if necessary.
