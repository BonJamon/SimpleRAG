Configuring Network Devices for Optimal Performance
Welcome to QuickConnect's guide on configuring network devices for optimal performance. This document will help you support customers in optimizing their network setups. We'll cover the essential steps and best practices to ensure customers get the most out of their network devices.
1. General Recommendations

Ensure all firmware and software are up-to-date.
Position devices to avoid interference from other electronic devices and physical obstructions.
Utilize wired connections whenever possible to reduce wireless congestion.

2. Configuring Routers



Configuration Setting
Description
Recommendation




Wireless Channel
Channels used by the router for wireless communication.
Select a less congested channel (1, 6, or 11) using built-in tools or third-party apps.


Bandwidth
Amount of data that can be transmitted at once.
Use 20/40 MHz for 2.4 GHz networks and 80 MHz for 5 GHz networks for better performance.


QoS (Quality of Service)
Prioritizes bandwidth for critical applications and devices.
Enable QoS settings and prioritize streaming, gaming, and VoIP services.



3. Configuring Switches

Enable VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) to segment network traffic and improve security and performance.
Configure link aggregation to combine multiple network connections for increased bandwidth and redundancy.
Utilize Quality of Service (QoS) to prioritize critical data traffic.

4. Configuring Access Points (APs)

Place APs strategically to ensure optimal coverage and minimal overlap.
Configure APs to operate on different channels to reduce interference.
Consider implementing Wi-Fi 6 for better performance, especially in high-density environments.

5. Monitoring and Maintenance
Regularly monitor network performance and maintain devices to ensure optimal performance:

View usage statistics and identify bottlenecks through network monitoring tools.
Restart network devices periodically to clear any temporary issues.
Schedule regular firmware updates to ensure device stability and security.
