How to Configure a Router's Settings
This document provides a step-by-step guide for customer service agents at QuickConnect to assist customers in configuring their router's settings.
1. Accessing the Router's Interface

Ensure that the router is properly connected to a computer via Ethernet cable or Wi-Fi.
Open a web browser and enter the router's IP address in the address bar. Common IP addresses are:

            
192.168.0.1
192.168.1.1
10.0.0.1


Press Enter and the router’s login page should appear.

Note: If the login page does not appear, advise the customer to check their connection or consult the router's manual for the correct IP address.
2. Logging into the Router

Inform the customer to use the default login credentials typically found on a sticker on the router or in the user manual. Common defaults are:

            

Username
Password

If the default credentials do not work, suggest that the customer reset the router to its factory settings by pressing and holding the reset button for 10-15 seconds.

3. Configuring Basic Settings

Once logged in, navigate to the "Basic Setup" or "Quick Setup" section.
Update the following settings:

            
Network Name (SSID): Change the Wi-Fi network name to a preferred name for easy identification.
Password: Set a strong password for the Wi-Fi network. It should include a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters.
Security Mode: Ensure the security mode is set to WPA2 for optimal security.


Save the changes by clicking the "Save" or "Apply" button.

4. Advanced Configurations (Optional)
If customers need to make advanced configurations, guide them through the following as needed:

Port Forwarding: Navigate to the port forwarding section and enter the required information for forwarding specific ports.
QoS Settings: Help prioritize certain types of traffic to improve performance for specific applications or devices.
