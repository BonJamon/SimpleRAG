Steps to Resolve Connectivity Issues



Step
Description




1. Verify Internet Speed
Advise the customer to check their internet speed using a trusted speed test website. Ideally, the speed should be at least 5 Mbps for download and upload.


2. Check Device Compatibility
Ensure the customer's device meets the minimum system requirements for the telehealth platform. Update the device’s operating system if necessary.


3. Restart Devices
Instruct the customer to restart their modem, router, and the device they are using for telehealth.


4. Update Telehealth App
Ensure the customer is using the latest version of the telehealth application by checking for updates through their device’s app store.


5. Adjust Firewall/Security Settings
If the customer has a firewall or antivirus software, guide them to temporarily adjust the settings to allow the telehealth service.


6. Use an Ethernet Connection
For a more stable connection, recommend the customer use a wired Ethernet connection instead of Wi-Fi.


7. Contact Telehealth Provider
If issues persist, suggest the customer contact their telehealth service provider for additional assistance or alternative solutions.



Pro Tips

Bandwidth Management: Advise customers to limit the number of devices connected to their network during telehealth appointments to minimize interference.
Quiet Environment: Recommend conducting telehealth sessions in a quiet room with minimal background noise for better communication quality.
Preparation: Suggest that customers test their connection and equipment well before their scheduled appointment time.
