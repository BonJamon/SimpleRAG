General Troubleshooting Steps

Ensure the phone is properly connected to the network switch or router. Check the Ethernet cables for any visible damage or loose connections.
Verify the phone is receiving power. For Power over Ethernet (PoE) phones, confirm the switch is providing power. If using an AC adapter, ensure it is plugged in securely.
Restart both the IP phone and the network equipment (router, switch, etc.) to refresh the connection.
Check the phone's display for any error messages or indicators that might provide diagnostic information.
Access the phone's network settings menu to confirm it has received a valid IP address. If not, verify the DHCP server on the network is operational.
Test the call functionality by making an internal call (if available) to local numbers or extensions.
Update the firmware of the IP phone to the latest version provided by the manufacturer.
