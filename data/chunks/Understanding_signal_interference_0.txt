Understanding Signal Interference
Signal interference can significantly affect the quality of your telecommunications services. This document provides you with the necessary information to help customers understand, identify, and mitigate signal interference.
What is Signal Interference?
Signal interference occurs when unwanted signals disrupt the communication channels of your telecommunications devices. These disruptions can lead to poor connectivity, dropped calls, or slow data speeds.
Types of Signal Interference


Type
Description


Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)
Caused by external sources like electrical circuits, machinery, or electronic devices.


Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)
Interference caused by devices operating on the same or adjacent frequencies as the telecommunications equipment.


Environmental Interference
Interference from natural sources such as buildings, trees, and weather conditions.


Common Sources of Signal Interference

Electronic devices such as microwaves, cordless phones, and baby monitors.
Wi-Fi routers operating on the same frequency band as your telecom equipment.
Physical obstructions like walls, floors, and large metal objects.
Environmental factors such as thick foliage, heavy rain, and urban density.

Signs of Signal Interference

Dropped or poor-quality calls.
Slow internet speeds or frequent disconnections.
Inconsistent signal strength.
Unusual noises or static during calls.

How to Help Customers Troubleshoot Signal Interference

Verify the customer's location for potential physical obstructions.
Check for devices operating on the same frequency band and recommend relocating or turning off these devices temporarily.
Suggest switching the Wi-Fi channel on their router to reduce interference.
Recommend using a wired connection if possible to avoid wireless interference.
Advise the customer to ensure their telecom equipment is updated with the latest firmware.
In case of persistent issues, consider relocating the main telecom equipment to a central and elevated position.
