Understanding How to Provide Network Health Reports
Introduction
Network Health Reports offer crucial insights into the performance and stability of a customer's telecommunications network. These reports help detect issues early, ensuring optimal network service performance. This guide will help you understand how to provide these reports effectively.
Steps to Generate a Network Health Report

Access the Customer’s Account: Login to the QuickConnect admin dashboard and navigate to the customer's account details.
Navigate to the Network Health Section: Click on the 'Network Health' tab to access the network performance analytics.
Select the Time Frame: Choose the time interval for which the report needs to be generated (e.g., last 24 hours, last week, last month).
Generate the Report: Click on the 'Generate Report' button. This may take a few moments depending on the data volume.
Download or Email the Report: Once generated, the report can be downloaded as a PDF or sent directly to the customer's email.

Components of a Network Health Report
A Network Health Report typically includes the following components:

Uptime Statistics: A summary of the network’s uptime and any periods of downtime.
Latency Metrics: Details on network latency, including average, maximum, and minimum values over the selected period.
Packet Loss Data: Information on any packet loss encountered during the report timeframe.
Error Rates: Data regarding any errors or faults within the network.
Traffic Analysis: Insights into network traffic patterns, including data usage trends.

Considerations for Interpretations
When reviewing and discussing Network Health Reports with customers, keep the following considerations in mind:

Consistency: Point out trends and consistent performance issues that may require a long-term solution.
Severity: Highlight any critical issues or anomalies that might indicate immediate attention.
Impacts: Explain how particular metrics (like high latency or packet loss) may impact the customer’s network performance.
