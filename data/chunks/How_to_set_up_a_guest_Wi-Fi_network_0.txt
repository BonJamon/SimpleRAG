QuickConnect: Setting Up a Guest Wi-Fi Network



Setting Up a Guest Wi-Fi Network
Setting up a guest Wi-Fi network allows visitors to access the internet without gaining access to your primary home network. Follow the steps below to create a separate guest network using your QuickConnect router.
Steps to Set Up a Guest Wi-Fi Network

Access the Router's Web Interface:

Open a web browser.
Enter the router's IP address in the address bar (usually 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1).
Log in with your router's username and password. If you haven’t changed them, the default credentials are often found on the router label or in the user manual.


Navigate to the Wireless Settings:

Find and click on the Wireless Settings or Wi-Fi Settings tab in the router’s menu.
Select the option for Guest Network or Guest Wi-Fi.


Configure Guest Network Settings:

Enable Guest Network: Ensure that the checkbox or switch for enabling the guest network is turned on.
Network Name (SSID): Set a distinct name for the guest network to differentiate it from your primary network.
Security Settings: Choose a WPA2 or WPA3 encryption method and set a password to secure the network.
Access Control: Configure options such as bandwidth limits or access time restrictions if needed.


Save and Apply Settings:

Click on the Save or Apply button to update the router configuration with your new guest network settings.
Your router may reboot automatically to apply the changes.


Test the Guest Network:

Use a device to connect to the newly created guest Wi-Fi network using the SSID and password you configured.
Ensure that the device can access the internet but not your primary network resources.




Note: Some routers may offer additional features such as guest network isolation, which can prevent guests from communicating with devices on your primary network. Check your router's manual for more detailed instructions on available settings.
