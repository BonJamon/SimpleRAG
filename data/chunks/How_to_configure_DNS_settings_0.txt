How to Configure DNS Settings

DNS (Domain Name System) settings are crucial for translating domain names into IP addresses, allowing for efficient internet browsing. This documentation will guide QuickConnect customer service agents through the steps to configure DNS settings for customers.

Steps to Configure DNS Settings

Access the Router's Admin Interface:

Open a web browser and enter the router's IP address (commonly 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1).
Login using the admin credentials.

Navigate to DNS Settings:

Find the section labeled DNS, Network or Internet settings.

Enter the Preferred DNS Servers:

Locate the fields for primary and secondary DNS servers.
Enter the desired DNS server addresses. For example:

                

Provider
Primary DNS
Secondary DNS


Google DNS
8.8.8.8
8.8.4.4


Cloudflare DNS
1.1.1.1
1.0.0.1


OpenDNS
208.67.222.222
208.67.220.220




Save and Reboot:

Save the new DNS settings.
Reboot the router to apply changes.

Verify New DNS Settings:

After the router restarts, verify the new DNS settings by:

                
Opening the command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Mac/Linux).
Running the command: nslookup www.example.com
The displayed DNS server should match the new settings.
