Common Landline Issues

No Dial Tone
Static or Noise on the Line
Can't Receive Calls
Can't Make Outgoing Calls
Intermittent Service

Troubleshooting Steps
Follow these steps to help resolve the customer's landline issues:
1. No Dial Tone

Ensure all telephone cords are plugged in securely.
Check if the phone itself is working by trying another handset.
Ensure there are no outages in the customer’s area. You can check this in the system dashboard.
If the problem persists, escalate to technical support.

2. Static or Noise on the Line

Make sure all equipment, like modems and fax machines, are properly filtered.
Check the line with a different phone to rule out a faulty device.
Ask if electrical equipment or large metal objects are near the phone; these can cause interference.
Suggest the customer to disconnect and reconnect all cords.

3. Can't Receive Calls

Confirm the phone ringer is turned on.
Verify that call forwarding is not engaged.
Check with the customer if they have enabled Do Not Disturb.
Ensure the line is not shared with another device such as a DSL modem.

4. Can't Make Outgoing Calls

Ensure there is no call bar or block enabled on the line.
Check if the dialing pattern is correct, especially for international numbers.
Test using another phone to rule out equipment issues.

5. Intermittent Service

Inquire about any recent changes to the home network setup or new devices which might be interfering.
Check for any wiring issues or loose connections inside the home.
Perform a line test if possible to identify external faults.
If the issue is not resolved, escalate to a higher tier of technical support.

Escalation Procedures
If the customer's issue persists after troubleshooting, follow these escalation steps:

Document all the troubleshooting steps taken and the customer's responses.
Provide a detailed description of the issue and any pertinent data on the system.
Contact the next level of technical support and provide all gathered information.
Ensure the customer is updated on the status and expected resolution time.
