        Step-by-Step Guide:

    

Listen to the Customer: Understand the issue by asking relevant questions to identify the nature of the spam complaint.
Verify the Details: Confirm the customer's account information and note any specifics about the spam they are reporting (e.g., date and time received, sender details).
Log the Complaint: Use the internal Complaint Management System (CMS) to record all details of the spam complaint. Ensure accuracy of information.
Instruct the Customer: Provide guidelines to the customer on how to block spam messages and adjust their spam filters.

Guide them through the process of changing email filters to reduce spam messages.


Escalate if Needed: If the spam complaint is severe or recurring, escalate it to the technical team for further investigation.
Follow Up: Ensure you or a team member follows up with the customer to confirm the issue has been resolved or to provide additional assistance.
