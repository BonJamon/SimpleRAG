Steps to Resolve Slow Internet Speeds
Verify Current Speed:
Ask the customer to run a speed test using a reliable service like Speedtest.net and report the results.
Check for Outages:
Check QuickConnect's system for any reported outages or maintenance activities that might be affecting the customer’s area.
Restart Equipment:
Guide the customer to power cycle their modem and router. Instruct them to unplug both devices, wait for 30 seconds, and then plug them back in.
Check Wired Connection:
Instruct the customer to connect their device directly to the modem via an ethernet cable to rule out router or Wi-Fi issues.
Update Firmware and Software:
Ensure that the customer’s modem/router firmware and their device's network drivers are up to date.
Check for Interference:
Advise the customer to move their router to a central location, away from potential sources of interference (e.g., microwave ovens, cordless phones).
Run Network Diagnostics:
Use the diagnostic tools available in QuickConnect's system to remotely check the health and performance of the customer’s network.
