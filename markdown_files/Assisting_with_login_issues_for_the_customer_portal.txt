Description

Customers may forget their password and need assistance with resetting it.
Username Not Recognized
The system does not recognize the customer's username.
Account Locked
Too many unsuccessful login attempts can lock the customer's account.
Network Issues

Troubleshooting Steps
Forgotten Password: Guide the customer to the "Forgot Password" link on the login page to reset their password. Ensure they check their email's spam/junk folder for the reset link.
Username Not Recognized: Verify the correct username with the customer. It may be their email address or a unique username. Check for typos and ensure there are no extra spaces.
Account Locked: Explain the lockout policy (e.g., a 30-minute lockout after 5 failed attempts). You may also need to manually unlock their account.
Network Issues: Suggest checking their internet connection, disabling VPNs, or trying a different browser. If the problem persists, escalate to technical support.
Important Tips
Always verify the customer's identity before making any changes to their account.
Document all actions taken in the customer's support ticket for future reference.
Never request or record the customer's password for security reasons.
Contacting Technical Support
If you've followed all troubleshooting steps and the customer's login issue remains unresolved, escalate the case to technical support. Provide them with the customer's details and a summary of the steps you've taken so far.
