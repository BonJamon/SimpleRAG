        <h2>What is Network Latency?</h2>
        <p>Network latency refers to the time it takes for data to travel from the sender to the receiver across a network. It is typically measured in milliseconds (ms). Lower latency indicates a more responsive network, while higher latency can result in delays.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Factors Affecting Network Latency</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Distance:</strong> The physical distance between the source and destination. Greater distances equate to higher latency.</li>
            <li><strong>Network Congestion:</strong> High amounts of data traffic can slow down network performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Routing:</strong> The number of intermediary devices (routers and switches) the data passes through.</li>
            <li><strong>Hardware Quality:</strong> The performance capabilities of networking hardware.</li>
            <li><strong>Transmission Medium:</strong> The type of connection (fiber, copper, wireless) used.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Impact of Network Latency</h2>
        <ul class="impact-list">
            <li><strong>Online Gaming:</strong> High latency can result in lag, making it difficult to play in real-time.</li>
            <li><strong>Video Conferencing:</strong> Latency can cause delays, leading to poor communication and out-of-sync audio/video.</li>
            <li><strong>Web Browsing:</strong> Slower load times for web pages, affecting user experience.</li>
            <li><strong>File Transfers:</strong> Increased time for uploading or downloading files.</li>
            <li><strong>Cloud Services:</strong> Slower interactions with cloud-based applications due to delayed data transmission.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Measure Network Latency</h2>
        <p>Network latency can be measured using tools like <strong>ping</strong> and <strong>traceroute</strong>:</p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Tool</th>
                    <th>Usage</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Ping</td>
                    <td>Sends packets to a destination and measures the time it takes to receive a response.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Traceroute</td>
                    <td>Displays the route taken by packets across the network and measures each hop's latency.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2>Steps to Improve Network Latency</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Upgrade to higher-quality networking hardware.</li>
            <li>Reduce the number of intermediary devices on the network.</li>
            <li>Use wired connections instead of wireless where possible.</li>
            <li>Ensure your network is not congested by unnecessary traffic.</li>
            <li>Seek professional advice for advanced network optimization.</li>
