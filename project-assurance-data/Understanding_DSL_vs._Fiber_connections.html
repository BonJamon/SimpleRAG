<h1>Understanding DSL vs. Fiber Connections</h1>

<p>Welcome to the QuickConnect Customer Service Documentation! This guide will help you understand the key differences between DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) and Fiber Optic internet connections. This knowledge will enable you to better assist customers with their internet service queries.</p>

<h2>1. Overview of DSL and Fiber Connections</h2>
<p>DSL and Fiber are two types of broadband internet services available to customers. Each has its own characteristics, advantages, and potential drawbacks.</p>

<div class="highlight">
    <h3>DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Uses existing telephone lines for data transmission.</li>
        <li>Generally offers speeds ranging from 1 Mbps to 100 Mbps.</li>
        <li>Speed can decrease with increased distance from the service provider's central office.</li>
        <li>Widely available, especially in rural and remote areas.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="highlight">
    <h3>Fiber Optic</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Uses fiber optic cables that transmit data using light signals.</li>
        <li>Offers much higher speeds, typically from 100 Mbps to 1 Gbps and beyond.</li>
        <li>Speed and performance remain consistent regardless of distance.</li>
        <li>Less affected by electromagnetic interference.</li>
        <li>Availability may be limited to urban and suburban areas.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
