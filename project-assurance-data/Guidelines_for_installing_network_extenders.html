    <h1>Guidelines for Installing Network Extenders</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Network extenders, also known as Wi-Fi boosters or repeaters, are devices designed to extend the coverage area of your wireless network. They function by receiving the existing Wi-Fi signal, amplifying it, and then transmitting the boosted signal. This document provides step-by-step guidelines to assist customers in installing network extenders effectively.</p>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensure you have your network extender device and its power adapter.</li>
        <li>Have your Wi-Fi network name (SSID) and password handy.</li>
        <li>Download the manufacturer's installation app if available (e.g., TP-Link Tether, Netgear Nighthawk).</li>
        <li>Identify a location approximately midway between your router and the area with weak signal coverage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Installation Steps</h2>

            <th>Step</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Step 1</td>
            <td><strong>Plug in the Extender:</strong> Connect the network extender to a power outlet.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Step 2</td>
            <td><strong>Power On:</strong> Turn on the device and wait for the power LED to become stable.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Step 3</td>
            <td><strong>Connect to Extender Network:</strong> 
                <ol>
                    <li>Using a computer or mobile device, connect to the Wi-Fi network emitted by the extender (usually named something like "EXTENDERNAME_SETUP").</li>
                    <li>Open a web browser and enter the IP address provided in the manual (e.g., 192.168.1.1) or use the mobile app.</li>
                </ol>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Step 4</td>
            <td><strong>Configure Extender:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Follow the on-screen instructions to select your existing Wi-Fi network.</li>
                    <li>Enter your Wi-Fi password to connect the extender to your network.</li>
                    <li>Finalize the setup by assigning a name to the extended network, if required.</li>
                </ol>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Step 5</td>
            <td><strong>Positioning:</strong> Place the extender in its optimal position for maximum coverage.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Step 6</td>
            <td><strong>Test Connection:</strong> Connect a device to the extended network and verify the performance improvements.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Troubleshooting Tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If the extender isn’t connecting, try resetting the device and rerunning the setup process.</li>
        <li>Ensure the extender is placed within range of the main router signal.</li>
        <li>Check for firmware updates for the extender as they may resolve connectivity issues.</li>
        <li>Move the extender closer to the router if performance issues persist.</li>
        <li>Ensure that no significant obstructions are blocking the extender's signal.</li>
    </ul>
