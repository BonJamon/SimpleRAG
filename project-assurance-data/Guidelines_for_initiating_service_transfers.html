        <div class="note">
            <b>Note:</b> Service transfers are the process by which a current QuickConnect service plan is moved from one location to another or from one customer to another. These should be handled with care to ensure seamless continuity of service.

            <li><b>Customer Transfer:</b> Changing ownership of the service from one customer to another.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps for Initiating a Service Transfer</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Customer Verification:</b> Verify the identity of the customer requesting the transfer. Ensure they have the necessary permissions and that their account is in good standing.</li>
            <li><b>Collect Transfer Details:</b> Gather all relevant information including:
                <ul>
                    <li>Current and new service addresses</li>
                    <li>Preferred transfer date</li>
                    <li>Contact information of new customers (if applicable)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Check for Service Availability:</b> Confirm that QuickConnect services are available at the new location.</li>
            <li><b>Schedule the Transfer:</b> Coordinate a date and time for the service transfer, keeping in mind the customer’s preferred date.</li>
            <li><b>Service Confirmation:</b> Inform the customer about the transfer details and confirm the service transfer appointment.</li>
            <li><b>Installation and Setup:</b> Ensure that all technical setups and installations are completed on the scheduled date.</li>
            <li><b>Follow-Up:</b> Contact the customer post-transfer to ensure everything is working as expected and address any issues promptly.</li>
