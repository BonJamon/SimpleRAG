    <h1>Assisting with Router Firmware Updates</h1>
    <p>This document explains how customer service agents at QuickConnect can assist customers with updating their router firmware. Ensuring that customers have up-to-date firmware is essential for optimal performance and security.</p>
    
    <h2>Steps to Assist with Router Firmware Updates</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Identify the Router Model:</strong> 
            Make sure to get the exact model and version of the router from the customer. This information is typically found on a label on the router or within the router's admin interface.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Locate the Latest Firmware:</strong> 
            Direct the customer to the router manufacturer’s website. Below are links to common manufacturers:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.netgear.com/support">Netgear</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.tp-link.com/us/support">TP-Link</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.linksys.com/us/support">Linksys</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://support.asus.com">ASUS</a></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Download the Firmware:</strong> 
            Instruct the customer to download the appropriate firmware file for their router model from the manufacturer's website.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Access the Router Admin Interface:</strong> 
            Guide the customer to log in to their router's administrative interface, typically accessed via a web browser by entering the router’s IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Install the Firmware Update:</strong> 
            Advise the customer to navigate to the firmware update section within the admin interface and upload the downloaded firmware file. They should follow any on-screen instructions to complete the update.
        </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Common Issues and Troubleshooting</h3>
    
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Issue</th>
            <th>Possible Solution</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Router is not responding/became unresponsive</td>
            <td>Advise the customer to perform a reboot by unplugging the router, waiting for 30 seconds, and then plugging it back in. If the issue persists, suggest resetting to factory settings and reattempting the firmware update.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Unable to access the router’s admin interface</td>
            <td>Check if the customer is connected to the router’s network. Verify the router’s IP address and ensure the customer is using the correct login credentials.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Firmware update fails</td>
            <td>Ensure the customer has downloaded the correct firmware file for their router model. Verify that the file is not corrupted, and suggest re-downloading if necessary.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <h3>Important Considerations</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Advise customers to back up their current router settings before proceeding with the firmware update.</li>
        <li>Firmware updates should be performed with a stable power supply to avoid interruptions.</li>
        <li><span class="important">Warn customers that firmware updates may reset the router to default settings, and they may need to reconfigure their network settings afterward.</span></li>
    </ul>
