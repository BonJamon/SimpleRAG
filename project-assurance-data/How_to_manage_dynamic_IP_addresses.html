    </header>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Dynamic IP addresses are IP addresses that are assigned to devices on a network but change periodically. These IP addresses are managed by a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server which automatically assigns a temporary IP address to a device from a predefined range. This guide will help QuickConnect customer service agents in supporting customers who have inquiries related to dynamic IP addresses.</p>

        <h2>Steps to Manage Dynamic IP Addresses</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Identify the Device:</strong> Determine the device for which the IP address needs to be managed. This can be any networking device like a computer, phone, or router.</li>
            <li><strong>Access DHCP Settings:</strong> Many modern routers allow users to access DHCP settings through their web interface. Instruct the customer to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Open a web browser.</li>
                    <li>Enter the router's IP address (usually 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1).</li>
                    <li>Login to the router's admin interface using the provided credentials.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Locate the DHCP Settings:</strong> Navigate to the appropriate section often labeled as "Network Settings," "LAN Setup," or "DHCP Settings." The terminology may vary depending on the router.</li>
            <li><strong>Adjust the IP Address Range:</strong> Here, users can often specify the range of IP addresses that the DHCP server can assign. Ensure they know to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Set an appropriate range to include enough IP addresses for their network.</li>
                    <li>Avoid overlapping with static IP addresses to prevent conflicts.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Reserve IP Addresses:</strong> If a customer wants certain devices to always receive the same IP address, guide them to create DHCP reservations which map specific IP addresses to the devices' MAC addresses.</li>
            <li><strong>Save and Reboot:</strong> After making changes, instruct the customer to save the settings and reboot the router to apply the new configuration.</li>
        </ol>
